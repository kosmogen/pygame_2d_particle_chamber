# pygame_2d_particle_chamber

## Intention
I am using what I have learned about masks and collision detection to make a simulation of particles colliding with an arbitarty shape. I intent to start with a simple sand like bounce off behavior upon collision and work my way into making a viscous fluid simulation that acts like a wind tunnel.
